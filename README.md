# YouTube Search React Demo

Just a simple demo of a YouTube search built in React ⚛️

### Getting Started

Checkout this repo:

```
> git clone https://github.com/adrichey/ReduxSimpleStarter.git
> cd ReduxSimpleStarter
> touch .env
```

From here, you will need to sign up for a YouTube API key and add it to your `.env` file. Once you have the API key, open `.env` and add it as follows:

```
API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXX
```

From here you will install your dependencies and start the dev server:

```
> npm install
> npm run start
```

### Additional Commands

ESLint and Airbnb standards have been added to the project for code cleanliness. Mocha/Chai/Enzyme have been added for testing.

```
> npm run lint
> npm run test
```
